		* bug on lowlevel_randomise_trees_with_spr_string: can't handle same tree repeated, as input, it seems 
2016.08.05
	* spr distances: both distsignal and spr_distance programs now report SPR and SPR_extra separately
	* TODO: redo 001 notebook with spr+spr_extra (which may explain why dSPR values are lower...) since 
	gf_spr_distance program did not take spr_extra into account (now it does)

	* topology_to_string_create_name(): similar to topology_to_string_by_id() but creates names like "s1", "s2" etc	(instead of 1,2,)
	* distmatrix_genetree_sptree, generate_spr_trees: two small programs based on guenomu's test ones. STDOUT results. 
	* TODO: give rooted reconc distances (now only unrooted is given). This implies in adding vars to reconc structure.

	* GNU11: replaced "inline" for "extern" on headers (https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Inline.html)
