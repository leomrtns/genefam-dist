	* topology_to_string_create_name(): similar to topology_to_string_by_id() but creates names like "s1", "s2" etc	(instead of 1,2,)
	* distmatrix_genetree_sptree, generate_spr_trees: two small programs based on guenomu's test ones. STDOUT results. 
	* TODO: give rooted reconc distances (now only unrooted is given). This implies in adding vars to reconc structure.
