  abstract      = "Summary: Both theory and empirical evidence indicate that
                   phylogenies (trees) of different genes (loci) do not display
                   precisely matched topologies. This phylogenetic incongruence
                   is attributed to the reticulated evolutionary history of
                   most species due to meiotic sexual recombination in
                   eukaryotes, or horizontal transfers of genetic materials in
                   prokaryotes. Nonetheless, most genes do display
                   topologically related phylogenies; this implies they form
                   cohesive subsets (clusters). In this work, we compare
                   popular clustering methods, and show how the performance of
                   the normalized cut framework is efficient and statistically
                   accurate when obtaining clusters on the set of gene trees
                   based on the geodesic distance between them over the
                   Billera-Holmes-Vogtmann (BHV) tree space. We proceed to
                   present a computational study on the performance of
                   different clustering methods with and without preprocessing
                   under different distance metrics and using a series of
                   dimension reduction techniques. Results: First, we show
                   using simulated data that indeed the Ncut framework
                   accurately clusters the set of gene trees given a species
                   tree under the coalescent process. We then depict the
                   success of our framework by comparing its performance to
                   other clustering techniques, including k-means and
                   hierarchical clustering. The main computational results can
                   be summarized to the stellar performance of the Ncut
                   framework even without dimension reduction, the similar
                   performance portrayed by k-means and Ncut under most
                   dimension reduction schemes, the utter failure of
                   hierarchical clustering to accurately capture clusters, as
                   well as the significantly better performance of the NJp

              an organismal tree of gamma-proteobacteria that can be

              several recently developed analytical methods to this problem,
              for the first time. Our heat map analyses of P values and of
              bootstrap bipartitions show the presence of conflicting
              phylogenetic signals among these core genes. Our synthesis
              reconstruction suggests that at least 10\% of these genes have
              been laterally transferred during the divergence of the
              gamma-proteobacteria, and that for most of the rest, there is too
              little phylogenetic signal to permit firm conclusions about the
              mode of inheritance. Although there is clearly a central tendency
              in this data set (it is far from random), lateral gene transfers
              cannot be ruled out. Instead of an organismal tree, we propose

  author    = "Gori, Kevin and Suchan, Tomasz and Alvarez, Nadir and Goldman,
               Nick and Dessimoz, Christophe",
  abstract  = "Phylogenetic inference can potentially result in a more accurate
               tree using data from multiple loci. However, if the loci are
               incongruent--due to events such as incomplete lineage sorting or
               horizontal gene transfer--it can be misleading to infer a single
               tree. To address this, many previous contributions have taken a
               mechanistic approach, by modelling specific processes.
               Alternatively, one can cluster loci without assuming how these
               incongruencies might arise. Such ``process-agnostic'' approaches
               typically infer a tree for each locus and cluster these. There
               are, however, many possible combinations of tree distance and
               clustering methods; their comparative performance in the context
               of tree incongruence is largely unknown. Furthermore, because
               standard model selection criteria such as AIC cannot be applied
               to problems with a variable number of topologies, the issue of
               inferring the optimal number of clusters is poorly understood.
               Here, we perform a large-scale simulation study of phylogenetic
               distances and clustering methods to infer loci of common
               evolutionary history. We observe that the best-performing
               combinations are distances accounting for branch lengths
               followed by spectral clustering or Ward's method. We also
               introduce two statistical tests to infer the optimal number of
               clusters and show that they strongly outperform the silhouette
               criterion, a general-purpose heuristic. We illustrate the
               usefulness of the approach by (i) identifying errors in a
               previous phylogenetic analysis of yeast species and (ii)
               identifying topological incongruence among newly sequenced loci
               of the globeflower fly genus Chiastocheta. We release treeCl, a

               from population genetics and epidemiology to microbiology,

               of trees, compare different trees, and identify distinct modes
               of division within trees is essential to all these research
               areas. But despite wide-ranging applications, there currently
               exists no common, comprehensive framework for such analyses.
               Here we present a graph-theoretical approach that provides such
               a framework. We show how to construct the spectral density
               profiles of phylogenetic trees from their Laplacian graphs.
               Using ultrametric simulated trees as well as non-ultrametric
               empirical trees, we demonstrate that the spectral density
               successfully identifies various properties of the trees and
               clusters them into meaningful groups. Finally, we illustrate how
               the eigengap can identify modes of division within a given tree.
               As phylogenetic data continue to accumulate and to be integrated
               into various areas of the life sciences, we expect that this

               framework for lower dimensional representation of text data in
               vector space based information retrieval is proposed using
               minimization and a matrix rank reduction formula. We illustrate
               how the commonly used Latent Semantic Indexing based on the
               Singular Value Decomposition (LSI/SVD) can be derived as a
               method for dimension reduction from our mathematical framework.
               Then two new methods for dimension reduction based on the

  abstract = "Spectral clustering methods have various real-world applications,

              arbitrary shaped clusters, resulting thus in high clustering
              accuracy, the heavy computational cost limits their scalability.
              In this paper, we propose an accelerated spectral clustering
              method based on landmark selection. According to the Weighted
              PageRank algorithm, the most important nodes of the data affinity
              graph are selected as landmarks. Furthermore, the selected
              landmarks are provided to a landmark spectral clustering
              technique to achieve scalable and accurate clustering. In our
              experiments, by using two benchmark face and shape image data
              sets, we examine several landmark selection strategies for
              scalable spectral clustering that either ignore or consider the
              topological properties of the data in the affinity graph. Also,

              hierarchical phylogenetic model in which the evolution of
              species, locus and gene trees is governed by global and local
              parameters (e.g., genome-wide, species-specific, locus-specific),
              that can be fixed or be sampled from a priori statistical
              distributions. SimPhy also incorporates comprehensive models of
              substitution rate variation among lineages (uncorrelated relaxed
              clocks) and the capability of simulating partitioned nucleotide,
              codon and protein multilocus sequence alignments under a plethora

              models and/or large trees, being an order of magnitude faster

               the evolutionary process but comparisons of trees from different
               processes are hindered by the challenge of completely describing
               tree shape. We present a full characterization of the shapes of
               rooted branching trees in a form that lends itself to natural
               tree comparisons. We use this characterization to define a
               metric, in the sense of a true distance function, on tree
               shapes. The metric distinguishes trees from random models known
               to produce different tree shapes. It separates trees derived
               from tropical versus USA influenza A sequences, which reflect
               the differing epidemiology of tropical and seasonal flu. We
               describe several metrics based on the same core

  abstract = "Trees that illustrate patterns of ancestry and evolution are a
              central tool in many areas of biology. Comparing evolutionary
              trees to each other has widespread applications in comparing the
              evolutionary stories told by different sources of data, assessing
              the quality of inference methods, and highlighting areas where
              patterns of ancestry are uncertain. While these tasks are
              complicated by the fact that trees are high-dimensional
              structures encoding a large amount of information, there are a
              number of metrics suitable for comparing evolutionary trees whose
              tips have the same set of unique labels. There are also metrics
              for comparing trees where there is no relationship between their
              labels: in 9unlabelled9 tree metrics the tree shapes are compared
              without reference to the tip labels. In many interesting
              applications, however, the taxa present in two or more trees are
              related but not identical, and it is informative to compare the
              trees whilst retaining information about their tips9
              relationships. We present methods for comparing trees whose
              labels belong to a pre-defined set of categories. The methods
              include a measure of distance between two such trees, and a
              measure of concordance between one such tree and a hierarchical
              classification tree of the unique categories. We demonstrate the
              intuition of our methods with some toy examples before presenting
              an analysis of Mycobacterium tuberculosis trees, in which we use

              divergence-time estimation in the genomic era}",
  author   = "Smith, Stephen A and Brown, Joseph W and Walker, Joseph F",
  abstract = "Phylogenomic datasets have been successfully used to address
              questions involving evolutionary relationships, patterns of
              genome structure, signatures of selection, and gene and genome
              duplications. However, despite the recent explosion in genomic
              and transcriptomic data, the utility of these data sources for
              efficient divergence-time inference remains unexamined.
              Phylogenomic datasets pose two distinct problems for
              divergence-time estimation: (i) the volume of data makes
              inference of the entire dataset intractable, and (ii) the extent
              of underlying topological and rate heterogeneity across genes
              makes model mis-specification a real concern. ``Gene shopping'',
              wherein a phylogenomic dataset is winnowed to a set of genes with
              desirable properties, represents an alternative approach that
              holds promise in alleviating these issues. We implemented an
              approach for phylogenomic datasets (available in SortaDate) that
              filters genes by three criteria: (i) clock-likeness, (ii)
              reasonable tree length (i.e., discernible information content),
              and (iii) least topological conflict with a focal species tree
              (presumed to have already been inferred). Such a winnowing
              procedure ensures that errors associated with model (both clock
              and topology) mis-specification are minimized, therefore reducing
              error in divergence-time estimation. We demonstrated the efficacy
              of this approach through simulation and applied it to published
              animal (Aves, Diplopoda, and Hymenoptera) and plant (carnivorous
              Caryophyllales, broad Caryophyllales, and Vitales) phylogenomic
              datasets. By quantifying rate heterogeneity across both genes and
              lineages we found that every empirical dataset examined included
              genes with clock-like, or nearly clock-like, behavior. Moreover,
              many datasets had genes that were clock-like, exhibited
              reasonable evolutionary rates, and were mostly compatible with
              the species tree. We identified overlap in age estimates when
              analyzing these filtered genes under strict clock and
              uncorrelated lognormal (UCLN) models. However, this overlap was
              often due to imprecise estimates from the UCLN model. We find
              that ``gene shopping'' can be an efficient approach to
              divergence-time inference for phylogenomic datasets that may
              otherwise be characterized by extensive gene tree heterogeneity.",

  abstract  = "Phylogenomic analyses of large sets of genes or proteins have
               the potential to revolutionize our understanding of the tree of
               life. However, problems arise because estimated phylogenies from
               individual loci often differ because of different histories,
               systematic bias, or stochastic error. We have developed
               Concaterpillar, a hierarchical clustering method based on
               likelihood-ratio testing that identifies congruent loci for
               phylogenomic analysis. Concaterpillar also includes a test for
               shared relative evolutionary rates between genes indicating
               whether they should be analyzed separately or by concatenation.
               In simulation studies, the performance of this method is
               excellent when a multiple comparison correction is applied. We
               analyzed a phylogenomic data set of 60 translational protein
               sequences from the major supergroups of eukaryotes and
               identified three congruent subsets of proteins. Analysis of the
               largest set indicates improved congruence relative to the full
               data set and produced a phylogeny with stronger support for five
               eukaryote supergroups including the Opisthokonts, the Plantae,
               the stramenopiles + Apicomplexa (chromalveolates), the

               stramenopiles and red algae, to the exclusion of alveolates,
               suggesting gene transfer from the red algal secondary symbiont
               to the ancestral stramenopile host nucleus during the origin of
               their chloroplast. Investigating phylogenomic data sets for
               conflicting signals has the potential to both improve
               phylogenetic accuracy and inform our understanding of genome

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Collective animal behavior, such as the flocking of
               birds or the shoaling of fish, has inspired a class of
               algorithms designed to optimize distance-based clusters in
               various applications, including document analysis and DNA
               microarrays. In a flocking model, individual agents respond only
               to their immediate environment and move according to a few
               simple rules. After several iterations the agents self-organize,
               and clusters emerge without the need for partitional seeds. In
               addition to its unsupervised nature, flocking offers several
               computational advantages, including the potential to reduce the
               number of required comparisons. FINDINGS: In the tool presented
               here, Clusterflock, we have implemented a flocking algorithm
               designed to locate groups (flocks) of orthologous gene families
               (OGFs) that share an evolutionary history. Pairwise distances
               that measure phylogenetic incongruence between OGFs guide flock
               formation. We tested this approach on several simulated datasets
               by varying the number of underlying topologies, the proportion
               of missing data, and evolutionary rates, and show that in
               datasets containing high levels of missing data and rate
               heterogeneity, Clusterflock outperforms other well-established
               clustering techniques. We also verified its utility on a known,
               large-scale recombination event in Staphylococcus aureus. By
               isolating sets of OGFs with divergent phylogenetic signals, we
               were able to pinpoint the recombined region without forcing a
               pre-determined number of groupings or defining a pre-determined
               incongruence threshold. CONCLUSIONS: Clusterflock is an
               open-source tool that can be used to discover horizontally
               transferred genes, recombined areas of chromosomes, and the
               phylogenetic 'core' of a genome. Although we used it here in an
               evolutionary context, it is generalizable to any clustering
               problem. Users can write extensions to calculate any distance
               metric on the unit interval, and can use these distances to
               'flock' any type of data.",

               tree methods able to deal with several sources of gene
               tree/species tree incongruence. At the same time, we need to
               make most use of all available data. Most species tree methods
               deal with single processes of phylogenetic discordance, namely,
               gene duplication and loss, incomplete lineage sorting (ILS) or
               horizontal gene transfer. In this manuscript, we address the
               problem of species tree inference from multilocus, genome-wide
               data sets regardless of the presence of gene duplication and
               loss and ILS therefore without the need to identify orthologs or
               to use a single individual per species. We do this by extending
               the idea of Maximum Likelihood (ML) supertrees to a hierarchical
               Bayesian model where several sources of gene tree/species tree
               disagreement can be accounted for in a modular manner. We
               implemented this model in a computer program called guenomu
               whose inputs are posterior distributions of unrooted gene tree
               topologies for multiple gene families, and whose output is the
               posterior distribution of rooted species tree topologies. We
               conducted extensive simulations to evaluate the performance of
               our approach in comparison with other species tree approaches
               able to deal with more than one leaf from the same species. Our
               method ranked best under simulated data sets, in spite of
               ignoring branch lengths, and performed well on empirical data,
               as well as being fast enough to analyze relatively large data
               sets. Our Bayesian supertree method was also very successful in
               obtaining better estimates of gene trees, by reducing the
               uncertainty in their distributions. In addition, our results
               show that under complex simulation scenarios, gene tree
               parsimony is also a competitive approach once we consider its
               speed, in contrast to more sophisticated models.",

  abstract = "Interest in congruence in phylogenetic data has largely focused
              on issues affecting multicellular organisms, and animals in
              particular, in which the level of incongruence is expected to be
              relatively low. In addition, assessment methods developed in the
              past have been designed for reasonably small numbers of loci, and
              scale poorly for larger datasets. However, there are currently
              over a thousand complete genome sequences available and of
              interest to evolutionary biologists, and these sequences are
              predominantly from microbial organisms, whose molecular evolution
              is much less frequently treelike than that of multicellular life
              forms. As such, the level of incongruence in these data is
              expected to be high. We present a congruence method that
              accommodates both very large numbers of genes and high degrees of
              incongruence. Our method uses clustering algorithms to identify
              subsets of genes based on similarity of phylogenetic signal. It
              involves only a single phylogenetic analysis per gene, and
              therefore computation time scales nearly linearly with the number
              of genes in the dataset. We show that our method performs very
              well with sets of sequence alignments simulated under a wide
              variety of conditions. In addition, we present an analysis of
              core genes of prokaryotes, often assumed to have been largely
              vertically inherited, in which we identify two highly incongruent
              classes of genes. This result is consistent with the complexity
              hypothesis.",

               the difficulty of interpreting data containing conflicting

               comparing trees which extracts distinct alternative evolutionary
               relationships embedded in data. We demonstrate detection and

               anole lizards, leading to alternate hypotheses about their

               derived from different genes of Ebolavirus and find that the

               three alternatives that differ in the deep branching structure.

  author        = "Xu, Chang and Tao, Dacheng and Xu, Chao",
  abstract      = "In recent years, a great many methods of learning from
                   multi-view data by considering the diversity of different
                   views have been proposed. These views may be obtained from
                   multiple sources or different feature subsets. In trying to
                   organize and highlight similarities and differences between
                   the variety of multi-view learning approaches, we review a
                   number of representative multi-view learning algorithms in
                   different areas and classify them into three groups: 1)
                   co-training, 2) multiple kernel learning, and 3) subspace
                   learning. Notably, co-training style algorithms train
                   alternately to maximize the mutual agreement on two distinct
                   views of the data; multiple kernel learning algorithms
                   exploit kernels that naturally correspond to different views
                   and combine kernels either linearly or non-linearly to
                   improve learning performance; and subspace learning
                   algorithms aim to obtain a latent subspace shared by
                   multiple views by assuming that the input views are
                   generated from this latent subspace. Though there is
                   significant variance in the approaches to integrating
                   multiple views to improve learning performance, they mainly
                   exploit either the consensus principle or the complementary
                   principle to ensure the success of multi-view learning.
                   Since accessing multiple views is the fundament of
                   multi-view learning, with the exception of study on learning
                   a model from multiple views, it is also valuable to study
                   how to construct multiple views and how to evaluate these
                   views. Overall, by exploring the consistency and
                   complementary properties of different views, multi-view
                   learning is rendered more effective, more promising, and has
                   better generalization ability than single-view learning.",

              which can be used for identifying clusters of similar trees and
