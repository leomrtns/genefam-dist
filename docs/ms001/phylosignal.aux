In panel A we show two simple cases for a sample of 8 gene family trees: at the top we compare each gene tree to two distinct reference (species) trees using the minimum number of duplications (duplication distance), and at the bottom we compare all sample gene trees to a single reference tree, but using two distinct metrics --- the Robinson-Foulds (RF) distance and the duplication distance. Both comparisons provide little information in isolation, but when combined allow for distinguishing the two groups of gene families (represented by distinct colours). Panel B shows how the tree signal of a single gene family tree can be calculated, given a set of species trees and a set of distances. Notice that currently we work with unrooted gene trees and rooted species trees. In panel C we show that once we have the tree signal from each gene family, then we can create a feature matrix (\IeC {\textquoteleft }design matrix\IeC {\textquoteright }) which can be used in downstream analyses. \relax }}{4}{figure.caption.1}}
