still not working with setup.py, I'm compiling by hand with 
gcc -fPIC  -lgenefamdist -L/home/leo/local/lib -I/usr/include/python3.5m -c treesignalmodule.c -o o.x
gcc -shared o.x -o treesignal.so


(by compiling by hand i cannot play with .SO name, since it looks for PyInit_treesignalmodule() at runtime within python)
